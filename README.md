# Fundamentals of Bioinformatics

This is intended to be an introduction to ggplot2 and dplyr to those in the Fundamentals of Bioinformatics course at the University of A Coru√±a without previous knowledge.

## Software requirements

Both R and Rstudio are available and runs on Windows, Linux and macOS.

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) s an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. RStudio requires a 64-bit operating systems (use older versions if you are on a 32 bit system) and is available **open source**.

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment. The base R system and a very large collection of packages that give you access to a huge range of statistical and analytical functionality are available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. However, using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. If you already have R and RStudio installed, please open RStudio and check for updates. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download de latest version for RStudio.

To check the R version you are using start RStudio and the first thing that appears on the console is the R version of the system. Go on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/) and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it.
